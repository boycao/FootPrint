1) Goals from last week:
- Implement revised UI to include two more columns (classes and methods)
- Restructure cache to reflect the UI change
- Test cache and extractor for the back end

2) Progress:

- Restructured the cache to reflect UI change. Our cache is now composed
of two layers that maps objectID --> methods --> local variables --> histories
to provide better data organization for the client. The first layer
is a cache that maps objectID to methods. The second layer then maps the
methods to their respective DebugCache (that maps local variables --> histories).
This cache is transferred over to the UI team to implement the new UI mockup.
- Setup performance test to automate timing pre-processing time. I wrote a Timer class
that times the execution of a method from the beginning to end and outputs
the result in milliseconds to a text file.

3) Goals for next week:
- Test cache and extractor for the back end
- Fix line number bug (line numbers currently are off by 1)
- Deploy the FootPrint to IntelliJ's to begin user testing
