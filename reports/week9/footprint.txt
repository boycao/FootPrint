1. Previous week’s plan:
 	-Work on setting breakpoints automatically so that footprint could extract full information
 	-Building a better UI to display the information

2. This week’s progress:
	-Implemented the new UI. We now organize the variables via the objects and methods that they
	belong to.
	-Deployed FootPrint plugin to IntelliJ's marketplace
	-Successfully set breakpoints under the hood. We're able to get histories of all local variables and fields
	before the user's breakpoint. However, we just have a bug that causes the thread to hang if user tries to
	step over a call to another method. We are currently looking into a fix for that. This is the final
	stretch to our implementation.

3. Next week’s plan:
    -Add more test projects to the test repo
 	-Run performance tests and usability tests

4. Meeting agenda:
   1. Grading criteria for the final product
   2. User study with TA's
