Previous Goals:

- Finish UI, improve organization of variables
- Set breakpoints under the hood
- Finalize how we will display values
- Create integration tests
- Run the experiments outlined in our report

This Week:

We restructured the class to map based on class and method names in order to
update the UI. UI team will now work on separating variables in the display.
We also have the basic breakpoint setting working in simple cases.
Currently working on deploying FootPrint. We also ran a few people
through our user study and the results were good so far; it seems like
students like FootPrint. Also added Likert questions as suggested;
made for easier analysis of results. Also working on collecting
more test programs for the pre-processing study.

Current Goals:

- Fix bugs with breakpoints
- finish reorganizing the UI
- complete design of pre-processing study
- deploy FootPrint
