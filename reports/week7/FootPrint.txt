1. Previous week’s plan: 
 	- Finish the build process of v1.0 Runner, Listener, and Extractor.
 	- Eric + Derek on Extractor, Hang + Audrey on Runner and Listener
 	- Try record states of local variables.

2. This week’s progress:
	- Completed last week's goal. Have v1.0 of runner, listener, extractor, cache
	- Gained access to all variables in the stack frame and were able to print their contents
	- Setup Travis CI
	- Wrote unit tests for VariableInfo class
	- Access and print fields of objects
	- Started on UI implementation. Got a basic FootPrint window that displays variables and their histories

3. Next week’s plan:
 	- Decide on how we want to represent the variable's histories
 	- Document methods and classes
 	- Implement UI to display objects and primitives
 	- Implement a way for users to specify what variables they want to track

4. Meeting agenda:
   1. Discuss possible ways to display histories and objects
   2. How to write integration testing for plugins
   3. Discuss only collecting data when the debugger is suspsend (i.e FootPrint
      tracks variable histories as the user is debugging)
