Previous Goals:

- Fix bugs with breakpoints
- finish reorganizing the UI
- complete design of pre-processing study
- deploy FootPrint

This Week:

We fixed the bug with the breakpoints by altering our invokeToString()
method. We also finished reorganizing the UI
by refactoring the cache. I added tests for the new MasterCache and updated
DebugCache. We also ran our complete user study and performance experiment
and revised our report. We also deployed version 1.0 of FootPrint
so the current version is now publicly available.

Current Goals:

- Improve minor UI aspects if time permits
- try to get TA review of FootPrint if possible
