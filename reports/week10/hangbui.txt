1) Goals from last week:
- Test cache and extractor for the back end
- Fix line number bug (line numbers currently are off by 1)
- Deploy the FootPrint to IntelliJ's to begin user testing

2) Progress:

- Fix breakpoint bug that causes the program to hang
- Deployed FootPrint version 1.0 that has breakpoints under the hood
and the updated UI with four columns.
- Ran runtime experiments that compares Footprint and Chronon on several
projects from intro CSE classes. However, Footprint is considerably slower
than we expected so if time permits, we will look into ways to optimize performance

3) Goals for next week:
- Optimize performance of Footprint if time permits
- Wrap up report
