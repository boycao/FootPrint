1. goals:
    -investigate possible changes/alternatives to setting breakpoints everywhere
     as it might record too much information.
2. This week I worked on fixing bugs in setting breakpoints everywhere and 
   researching the quuestion from last week. Regrading that, I believe setting many
   breakpoints is the easiest and simplest way to accomplish our goal. I also helped
   finish the report.
3. Future goals:
    -continue working on report
