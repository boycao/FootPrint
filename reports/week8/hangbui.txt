1) Goals from last week:
- Complete VariableInfo class to give the UI all the information it needs
  to display to the user (ex: Object's fields and value in a readable format, )
- Test cache and extractor for the back end
- Add comments to classes

2) Progress:

- Collection objects are displayed in their toString() format while
  other objects are displayed via their fields. If a field changed in
  said object, that change will be recorded by FootPrint and shown on
  the UI accordingly under that object's history.
- Collected fields and local variables on the stackframe
- Created a UI mockup to better organize variables. Currently, variables
  from different methods and classes are displayed together in one column.
  However, it may be more useful if we can separate them by classes and methods
  so users can better differentiate them.

3) Goals for next week:
- Implement revised UI to include two more columns (classes and methods)
- Restructure cache to reflect the UI change
- Test cache and extractor for the back end
