1. Previous goals:
    -finish the basic UI functionality:
      -displaying arrays
      -displaying changes in the history
    -research new ways to get local variable states 
2. This week, I began looking into ways to set breakpoints automatically and to
   use those breakpoints to extract the variable information. Right now, I am 
   having difficulty correctly extracting the information after a breakpoint is
   reached.
3. Future goals:
    -finish using breakpoints to get local variable states
    -research other ways to display variables (esp. objects) in the ui
